# Triplanetary Game Rules

## Overview

Triplanetary is a science fiction board game of ship-to-ship space combat and racing in the inner solar system. The game features realistic Newtonian physics where ships maintain momentum and velocity between turns.

## Game Components

### The Map
- Hexagonal grid representing space in the inner solar system
- Planetary orbits: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
- The Sun at the center
- Asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Various space stations and bases

### Ships
Each ship has the following characteristics:
- **Thrust Points**: Available fuel/engine power per turn
- **Hull Points**: Damage capacity before destruction
- **Cargo Capacity**: For transporting goods
- **Weapon Systems**: Lasers, missiles, or other armaments

## Core Mechanics

### Movement

Movement in Triplanetary uses a unique vector-based system:

1. **Current Velocity**: Each ship has a velocity arrow showing direction and speed
2. **Thrust Application**: Players spend thrust points to modify their velocity
3. **Movement Execution**: Ships move according to their velocity vector
4. **Momentum Conservation**: Velocity carries over to the next turn

#### Movement Steps (Each Turn)
1. Plot your velocity arrow from your current position
2. Optionally spend thrust points to modify the arrow (change direction or speed)
3. Move your ship to the hex indicated by the arrow's endpoint
4. The arrow becomes your new velocity for the next turn

#### Thrust Application Rules
- Each thrust point can shift your velocity arrow by one hex
- You can spend multiple thrust points in a single direction
- Thrust can be used to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction
- Ships have limited thrust points per turn

### Gravity

Celestial bodies exert gravitational effects:

1. **Gravity Wells**: Planets and the Sun have zones of gravitational influence
2. **Orbital Mechanics**: Ships in orbit must maintain proper velocity or fall/escape
3. **Gravity Assists**: Can use gravity to slingshot around planets
4. **Capture**: Flying too close to a planet without enough velocity may capture your ship

#### Gravity Effects by Zone
- **Inner Zone**: Strong gravity pull (multiple hexes)
- **Middle Zone**: Moderate gravity influence
- **Outer Zone**: Minimal gravity effect

### Combat

When ships occupy adjacent hexes or are within weapon range:

1. **Initiative**: Determine order based on scenario or dice roll
2. **Weapon Fire**: Declare targets and roll to hit
3. **Damage**: Apply hits to hull points
4. **Destruction**: Ship is destroyed when hull points reach zero

#### Weapon Types
- **Lasers**: Direct fire, line of sight required
- **Missiles**: Can track targets, limited ammunition
- **Mass Drivers**: High damage at close range

#### Combat Modifiers
- Range to target
- Relative velocity
- Ship size and profile
- Defensive systems active

## Game Scenarios

### Racing Scenarios
- Navigate through gates or checkpoints
- First ship to complete the course wins
- Must manage fuel efficiently
- Gravity assists can provide advantages

### Combat Scenarios
- Destroy enemy ships
- Protect convoys or stations
- Capture objectives
- Last ship standing wins

### Campaign Scenarios
- Linked missions with persistent ship status
- Resource management between missions
- Ship upgrades and repairs
- Multiple objectives and victory conditions

## Turn Sequence

1. **Initiative Phase**: Determine player order
2. **Movement Phase**:
   - Each player plots their velocity vectors
   - Apply thrust modifications
   - Move all ships simultaneously
   - Apply gravity effects
3. **Combat Phase**:
   - Declare attacks
   - Resolve weapon fire
   - Apply damage
4. **Maintenance Phase**:
   - Check victory conditions
   - Resolve special situations
   - Prepare for next turn

## Special Rules

### Docking
- Ships can dock at stations or planets
- Must match velocity with target
- Allows refueling and repairs
- Cargo transfer occurs when docked

### Collisions
- Ships in the same hex may collide
- Both ships take damage
- Intentional ramming possible but risky

### Asteroids
- Asteroid hexes provide cover
- Risk of collision when moving through
- Can be mined for resources in campaign play

### Fuel Management
- Thrust points are limited per turn
- Must manage fuel for entire mission
- Refueling requires docking
- Running out of fuel leaves ship drifting

## Victory Conditions

Victory is achieved by:
- Destroying all enemy ships (combat)
- Reaching destination first (racing)
- Completing scenario objectives
- Accumulating victory points (campaign)

## Advanced Rules

### Ship Customization
- Allocate points among systems
- Trade-offs between speed, armor, and weapons
- Specialized ships for different roles

### Crew Quality
- Experienced crews have bonuses
- Crew can be injured in combat
- Training improves performance

### Electronic Warfare
- Jamming enemy sensors
- Detecting hidden ships
- Missile countermeasures

## Designer Notes

The vector movement system is the heart of Triplanetary. Unlike traditional board games where pieces simply move from space to space, ships in Triplanetary must plan several turns ahead. A ship accelerating to chase an enemy must later use thrust to slow down or risk flying past the target.

Gravity adds another layer of complexity and strategy. Skilled players can use planetary gravity to conserve fuel or set up surprise attacks by "falling" toward an opponent.

## Quick Reference

### Movement Summary
- Plot velocity arrow from current position
- Spend thrust to modify (1 point = 1 hex shift)
- Move ship to arrow endpoint
- Arrow becomes next turn's velocity

### Combat Summary
- Adjacent ships can fire
- Roll to hit based on modifiers
- Apply damage to hull points
- Ship destroyed at 0 hull points

### Gravity Summary
- Planets pull ships toward them
- Effect increases closer to planet
- Can orbit if velocity is correct
- Use for fuel-free acceleration

## Resources and Credits

These rules are based on the 1973 Game Designers' Workshop edition of Triplanetary, designed by Game Designers' Workshop. The game has been reprinted and revised multiple times, with some variations in rules between editions.

For tournament play or competitive scenarios, consult the official rulebook for your edition.

## Rule Clarifications

### Simultaneous Movement
All ships move at the same time during the movement phase, which can lead to interesting tactical situations where ships pass through each other's hexes.

### Vector Limits
Some editions limit the maximum velocity a ship can achieve. Check your specific scenario or campaign rules.

### Damage Control
In extended campaigns, damaged systems can be repaired between missions or during maintenance phases.
