# Flows (Quortex) - Complete Game Rules

## Game Overview

**Flows** (also known as **Quortex**) is a strategic tile-placing game where players create flowing paths across a hexagonal board.

- **Players:** 2-6 players, ages 8+
- **Duration:** 25-35 minutes
- **Type:** Strategy, tile placement, path building

## Components

### Game Board
- **Hexagonal board** with 37 playable tile spaces
- **6 colored border pieces** (one for each potential player)
- **4 black border pieces** (for unoccupied edges)

### Game Tiles (40 total)
There are **four types of tiles**, each with **10 copies**, distinguished by the number of "sharp corners":

#### Type 0: No Sharp Corners ("Basketball")
- **3 curved flow paths** that create smooth S-curves and one straight line
- **Flow connections:** Creates flowing, curved pathways
- **Quantity:** 10 tiles

#### Type 1: One Sharp Corner ("Kimono")  
- **One sharp corner** where flows meet at a point
- **Flow connections:** One connection crosses the sharp corner, others curve around
- **Quantity:** 10 tiles

#### Type 2: Two Sharp Corners ("Rink")
- **Two sharp corners** creating angular connections
- **Flow connections:** Two sharp angular connections plus one straight connection
- **Quantity:** 10 tiles

#### Type 3: Three Sharp Corners ("Sharps")
- **Three sharp corners** forming a triangular meeting point
- **Flow connections:** All three connections meet at sharp angles
- **Quantity:** 10 tiles

### Player Equipment
- **6 sets of colored flow markers** (one set per player color)
- **Player trays** to hold flow markers

## Setup

### 1. Prepare the Tiles
- Place all 40 tiles **face down** on the table
- **Shuffle** them thoroughly
- **Stack** them in holders near each player for easy access

### 2. Choose Player Colors and Positions
- Each player **chooses a colored border piece** and takes the **corresponding tray of flow markers**
- Players **choose a side** of the hexagonal board for their border piece
- **Fill unclaimed edges** with black border pieces

### 3. Determine Player Order
- **Choose first player randomly**
- **Play proceeds clockwise** from the first player

## Objective

The goal varies based on the number of players:

### 2-3 Player Games (Individual Play)
- Each person plays **individually**
- Each player's border piece is **directly opposite a black border piece**
- **Winner:** First player to create a continuous flow from their colored border to the black border on the opposite side

### 4-6 Player Games (Team Play)
- Players form **teams with the player whose border piece is directly opposite** their own
- **Winner:** First team to create a continuous flow connecting their two border pieces

### 5 Player Games (Special Rules)
- **One player has no partner** (opposite a black border)
- That player **gets an extra turn** when their missing partner's position would have played
- **Winning conditions:** Solo player wins by reaching the opposite black border; paired players win by connecting to each other

## Gameplay

### Turn Sequence

1. **Draw a Tile**
   - Each player draws **any one face-down tile**
   - **Look at it secretly** without showing other players

2. **Place the Tile**
   - **Place your tile anywhere** in the hexagonal board area
   - Tile must be placed **legally** (see Legal Moves section)
   - **Rotate the tile** to any of the 6 possible orientations

3. **Update Flows**
   - If the new tile **touches another tile with flow** or **connects to a colored border edge**:
     - Use **matching flow markers** to show the complete path
     - **All players update their flows**, regardless of who placed the tile
     - Flows extend through **all connected pathways**

4. **Check for Victory**
   - Game ends immediately if any winning condition is met

5. **Next Player**
   - Turn passes to the **next player clockwise**

### Flow Mechanics

- **Flows automatically extend** through connected pathways when tiles are placed
- **Colors are preserved** - each player's flow markers maintain their unique color
- **Multiple flows can coexist** on the same tile through different pathways
- **Flows spread bidirectionally** from their source borders

## Legal Moves

### Core Legal Move Rule
Unless the tile **completes a winning path**, every placed tile must **leave a distinct route for each player or team to potentially win**.

### Legal Move Requirements

1. **Distinct Paths:** Each player/team must have their own **unique potential path to victory**
2. **No Complete Blocking:** No player/team can be **completely cut off** from potential victory
3. **Separate Routes:** Teams cannot be **forced to share the same pathway spaces** for their victory condition

### Checking Legality
Before placing a tile, examine the board to ensure:
- **Every player has a potential path** they could use to win
- **No two teams would be forced** to use identical pathway segments
- **At least one route remains open** for each player/team to their goal

### Mandatory Placement
- **If a tile CAN be legally placed, the player MUST play it**
- This is true **even if the placement causes another player/team to win**
- Players cannot choose to forfeit their turn

## Ending the Game

The game ends immediately when any of these conditions occur:

### Victory Conditions

1. **Individual Player Victory (2-3 player games)**
   - A player's flow reaches from their colored border to the opposite black border

2. **Team Victory (4-6 player games)**  
   - A team's flows connect their two border pieces together

3. **Simultaneous Victory**
   - If multiple players/teams complete their victory condition on the same turn, **the game ends in a tie**

### Unplayable Tile Victory
4. **Illegal Tile Victory**
   - If a player draws a tile that **cannot be legally placed anywhere** on the board
   - **That player/team wins immediately**
   - This represents successfully constraining all opponents' options

## Strategy Guide

### Core Strategic Principles

#### Constraint Strategy
- **Force opponent choices:** Create board positions where opponents must make moves that help you
- **Let opponents over-invest:** Allow opponents to focus heavily on one route, then force them to use a different path by blocking at the last minute
- **Maintain focused paths:** Often it's better to have only one viable path, as this makes you harder to block and easier to force opponents to play tiles that benefit you

#### Positioning Strategy
- **Control key bottlenecks:** Secure crucial connection points early
- **Create backup routes:** Don't rely on a single path to victory
- **Block efficiently:** Use minimal moves to maximum effect in constraining opponents

#### Forcing Moves
- **Create situations** where opponents must play a move that benefits both players
- **Make mutual benefit work for you** by ensuring the shared advantage helps your position more


## Special Situations

### 5-Player Game Extra Turn
- The **solo player** (opposite black border) gets an extra turn when their "missing partner's" position comes up in turn order
- This **compensates for their solo status** against the paired teams

### Stalemate Prevention
- The **mandatory placement rule** prevents games from stalling
- Players cannot simply refuse to play disadvantageous tiles
- This creates **dynamic, forced decision-making**

### Complex Flow Interactions
- **Multiple colors** can flow through the same tile via different pathways
- **Careful tile orientation** can control which flows connect
- **Flow markers clearly show** each player's controlled paths



## Tips for New Players

1. **Start Simple:** Focus on creating one clear path before worrying about blocking opponents
2. **Study the Tiles:** Familiarize yourself with how each tile type creates connections
3. **Practice Flow Visualization:** Learn to trace potential paths across the board
4. **Watch Legal Moves:** Pay attention to what makes moves legal vs illegal
5. **Think Ahead:** Consider how your placement affects all players' options

## Common Rules Questions

**Q: Can I place a tile that doesn't connect to anything?**
A: Yes, as long as it doesn't violate the legal move restrictions about player paths.

**Q: What if I accidentally place a tile illegally?**
A: Take back the illegal move and place the tile legally. In competitive play, this may carry penalties.

**Q: Can flows change direction on a tile?**
A: Flows follow the predetermined pathways on each tile type. The tile's orientation determines the actual flow directions.

**Q: What if we can't agree if a move is legal?**
A: Carefully trace each player's potential paths after the proposed placement. If any player would be completely blocked, the move is illegal.

**Q: Can I choose not to extend my flow when placing a tile?**
A: No, flows extend automatically when pathways connect. This is not optional.
