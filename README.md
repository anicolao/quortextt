# Quortex

A web-based game implementation with a player configuration startup screen.

## Features

### Game Configuration Screen

The initial implementation includes a fully functional game configuration screen:

- **Add Players**: Click "Add Player" to add up to 6 players
- **Remove Players**: Click the × button to remove any player
- **Change Colors**: Click on a player's color swatch to open the color picker
- **Color-Blind Friendly**: Uses a scientifically validated palette of 6 colors
- **Start Game**: Begin gameplay once at least one player is configured

All UI is rendered on HTML5 Canvas using TypeScript with Redux state management.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** for type-safe game logic and rendering
- **HTML5 Canvas** for the entire game interface (minimal HTML/CSS)
- **Redux** for state management
- **Vite** for development and building
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v9 or later)

### Installation
