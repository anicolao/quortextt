# Triplanetary

A web-based implementation of the classic 1973 science fiction board game **Triplanetary** by Game Designers' Workshop (GDW).

## About the Game

Triplanetary is a tactical space combat game set in the inner solar system. Players command spaceships navigating through a hexagonal map featuring realistic orbital mechanics and Newtonian physics. Ships accumulate velocity and must carefully plan their movements, as momentum carries over from turn to turn.

The game is notable for its realistic physics simulation, where ships don't simply move from hex to hex, but maintain velocity vectors that affect their trajectory. This creates strategic depth as players must plan several moves ahead, managing fuel consumption and positioning for combat or racing scenarios.

## Project Goals

This project aims to bring the classic Triplanetary experience to the web, making it accessible to a new generation of players while preserving the strategic depth and unique physics-based gameplay of the original.

### Features (Planned)

- **Hexagonal game board** representing the inner solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars orbits)
- **Realistic Newtonian physics** for ship movement
- **Turn-based gameplay** with movement planning
- **Multiplayer support** for online play
- **Single-player scenarios** from the original game
- **Campaign mode** with linked scenarios
- **Ship customization** and fleet management
- **Interactive tutorial** to learn the movement system

## Technology Stack

- Modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Canvas/SVG for hexagonal grid rendering
- WebSocket support for multiplayer functionality

## Game Modes

### Racing
Navigate through checkpoint gates using gravity and momentum to reach your destination first.

### Combat
Engage enemy ships in tactical space battles, managing weapons, shields, and maneuvering.

### Scenarios
Play through historical scenarios from the original game, including mining operations, piracy, and military campaigns.
