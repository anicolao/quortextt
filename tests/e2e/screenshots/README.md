# Flow Progression Screenshots

These screenshots demonstrate the correct flow behavior after fixing the tile orientation bug.

## Test Scenario (seed 167)
- Player 1 (blue) on edge 0 (row=-3)
- Player 2 (orange) on edge 3 (row=3)
- Tiles: TwoSharps, NoSharps, TwoSharps

## Expected Screenshots:

### Step 0: Initial State
- Empty board with blue edge at top, orange edge at bottom
- File: correct-flow-step0-initial.png

### Step 1: First Tile (TwoSharps at -3,2)
- Blue flows visible on W-E (horizontal) and NW-NE (slanted) paths
- SW-SE path remains grey (disconnected from player's edge)

### Step 2: Second Tile (NoSharps at 3,-1)
- Orange flows on player 2's tile
- Both tiles visible with their respective colors
- File: correct-flow-step2-second-tile.png

### Step 3: Flow Extended (TwoSharps at -3,3)
- Blue flow extends from first tile to third tile
- All connected paths show blue, disconnected paths stay grey

## Manual Verification
Run the application locally and follow these steps to verify:
1. Start game with 2 players
2. Use seed 167
3. Place tiles at the positions above with rotation 0
4. Verify flows match the expected behavior
