This user story demonstrates the lobby interaction functionality with mouse clicks, showing how players can be added from any of the four edges and removed using the X button.

## Test Flow

### 1. Initial Lobby State

The lobby starts with no players configured. Color buttons are visible on all four edges (bottom, right, top, left) allowing players to join from any edge.

### 2. Adding Players from All Edges

Players can join from any of the four edges by clicking the colored + buttons:
- Blue player joins from the bottom edge
- Orange player joins from the right edge  
- Green player joins from the top edge
- Yellow player joins from the left edge

Player labels appear near their chosen edge with their color indicator and player number (P1, P2, P3, P4).

### 3. Removing Player from Bottom Edge

Four players are configured, one at each edge.

![009-after-removing-right.png](009-after-removing-right.png)

The orange player from the right edge is removed, leaving three players.

![010-two-players-remain.png](010-two-players-remain.png)
