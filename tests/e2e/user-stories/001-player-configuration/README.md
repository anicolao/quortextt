## Continuous Flow

This user story is generated by a **single continuous test** that captures a screenshot after EVERY user action:
1. Starts from the initial state (0 players)
2. Adds players one by one (screenshots after each: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 players)
3. Removes players one by one (screenshots after each: 5, 4, 3, 2 players)
4. Starts the game (transition to gameplay)

Each step builds on the previous state with **exactly one user action** between screenshots. No hidden steps, no restarts. The test verifies Redux state at each step to ensure the documented behavior matches the actual implementation.

## Test Coverage

This story validates:
- Initial configuration screen rendering
- Progressive player addition (1 → 3 → 6 players)
- Removing players with Redux state verification
- Color availability after removal
- Re-adding players with different colors
- Starting game with valid configuration
- Screen transition from configuration → seating → gameplay
